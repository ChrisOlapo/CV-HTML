    <h2> Personal Profile</h2>
    <p>I am a proactive, self-motivated and adaptable professional with five years of experience in client-facing roles. Having completed a PRINCE2 certification in project coordination, I am knowledgeable of a variety of project management methodologies and possess a strong understanding of how to optimise product delivery and business processes. </p>
    <p>A strong interest in forecasting key business KPIs campaign including Gross Sales, Average Rep Sales and financial impact of supply risk has led to an interest in data analysis. Exercised data curiosity to understand the underlying mechanisms driving performance, highlighting risks/opportunities and proactively reporting to relevant stakeholders. This has led to an enjoyment of advanced Excel Techniques, and data visualisation software Power BI to relay a coherent story to stakeholders.</p>
